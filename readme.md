#Mahabharata#
----
[Mahabharata](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahabharata) is one longest epic ever written. 

Here this project is trying to look at epic from the Data Science perspective. 

## Brief of History of Mahabharata ##

It one of the oldest scripture and part of Indian history. Some may say it once again story of Good vs Evil. But that would not justify the literature. It is a story where no one is bad or good. But based on time and decision taken that justify the future event. 

### Karma ###
Theory of Karma, chain of events based on what we do is describe in (Bhagwad) Geeta as part of Mahabharata. So, in whole story every event have reason and result (another event). And things go on and on. No one can escape from it. Even God or Goddess.

### Popularity ###

> The Mahabharata is the longest known epic poem and has been described as "the longest poem ever written".Its longest version consists of over 100,000 shloka or over 200,000 individual verse lines (each shloka is a couplet), and long prose passages. About 1.8 million words in total, the Mahabharata is roughly ten times the length of the Iliad and the Odyssey combined, or about four times the length of the Ramayana

It has been translated in almost all Indian and many foreign languages. And also tried to portrait as TV series again and again. One of the popular one is from [1989](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0158417/). One can still buy a copy from Amazon (subs can hurt.). Or can read shorter version by [Devdutt Pattanaik](http://www.amazon.com/Jaya-Illustrated-Mahabharata-Devdutt-Pattanaik/dp/014310425X/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1461475939&sr=1-1&keywords=jaya+devdutt). But again there are many books available to choose from including original translated script. **That we are using here.**

## Mahabharata - As Project ##

As being so large and filled up with events and characters. It can be perfect play ground for [data science](http://evelinag.com/blog/2016/01-25-social-network-force-awakens/index.html#.VxxbczB97IU) experiments. 

Including finding influence of one person on another or one event on another.

Many authors told story of this epic in their own way. Here is another retry from data science point of view. 

## To Do ##

- [x] Extract all the possible characters and Places
- [ ] Separate places from characters
- [ ] Find the important ones
- [ ] Find the family tree / relation ship of characters 
- [ ] Combine names based on their plural names. Means Veda and Vedas are same when it comes to count frequency
- [ ] Find multiple names for single person. Krishna called by many names like Vasudeva, Goverdhan etc. Same true for Arjun and others. So find out people who are same but called with different name.
- [ ] Find out relationship between characters. Who is son of who, who is mother of who, who marries who. Here is interesting thing is a person can have two father. One is real one and one is biological one.
- [ ] Set up killed - killer relationship. All text filled up with war stories including the main Mahabharata war.
- [ ] Sentiment analysis

## Technology Used & Pull Request ##

- [F#](http://fsharp.org/) is used as basic programming language.
